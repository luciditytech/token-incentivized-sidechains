## Setup

1. `npm install -g truffle solhint`
  * [IDE Integrations for solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint#ide-integrations)
1. `git clone git@github.com:luciditytech/token-incentivized-sidechains.git`
1. `npm install`
1. `git hf init`

---

## Compiling and migrating smart contracts

1. `truffle compile`
1. `truffle migrate`

---

## Testing smart contracts
